    <p>Red Hot Chili Peppers (also sometimes shortened to the <em>Chili Peppers</em> or abbreviated as <em>RHCP</em>) are an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1983. The group's musical style primarily consists of <strong>rock</strong> with an emphasis on <strong>funk</strong>, as well as elements from other genres such as punk rock and psychedelic rock. When played live, they incorporate many aspects of jam band due to the improvised nature of much of their performances. Currently, the band consists of founding members <strong>Anthony Kiedis</strong> (vocals) and <strong>Michael</strong> <em>Flea</em> <strong>Balzary</strong> (bass), longtime drummer <strong>Chad Smith</strong>, and guitarist <strong>Josh Klinghoffer</strong>, who joined in late 2009, following the departure of John Frusciante. Red Hot Chili Peppers have won seven Grammy Awards, and have become one of the best-selling bands of all time, selling over 80 million records worldwide. In 2012, they were inducted into the <em>Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</em>.</p>
